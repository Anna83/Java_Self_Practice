/*
Create a custom class named Carpet with the following specifications:

    Attributes:
   			width
   			length
   			unitPrice
   			isPersian (boolean)

    Actions:
		calcCost(): calculate the total cost of the carpet and return it as a double.
   		toString(): display all the info of the carpet, including the total cost of the
   		carpet as calculated by calcCost()

   Price calculation formula:
   		Total price of carpet = (width * length) * unitPrice
   		If the carpet is Persian, add $200 to the totalPrice

    Create another class named CarpetClients, create multiple carpet
     objects, and test each function of the carpet object.
